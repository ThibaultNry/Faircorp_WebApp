    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      The Faircorp Web App was created during my Master of Engineering degree at
      Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne. <br />This specific front-end project
      was carried out under the supervision of Professor Nassim Djahnit, with
      the help of Professor Yousouf Taghzouti.<br />
      Part of the code was borrowed to Professor Quentin Richaud whose GitLab
      for the lecture is available
      <a href="https://gitlab.com/emse1/cours_js_1/-/tree/master">here</a>.
